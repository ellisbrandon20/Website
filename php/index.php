                          Howdy! My name is Brandon Ellis and I am a Computer Science at Texas A&M University, the greatest University on this planet! I chose Texas A&M because of the school’s core values that they engrave in every student, Excellence, Integrity, Leadership, Loyalty, Respect, and Selfless Service. I have always thought these core values have represented me since before I started to attend A&M. I chose this school to be surrounded by other people that believe in these core values because of the types of people these values build.

                          My interests in Computer Science are in Web Development, Human Computer Interaction, Mobile applications, and Core Software Development. I believe the reason I have these interests are because of my ability to be creative and artistic. The visual aspect of things draw to me and I love to see how certain aspects can draw some people’s attention but not others. My interests in these fields have strengthened since my internship with Cisco Systems in San Jose, California where I worked on the front end team of UCS-Central. This product is a manager tool for servers and we build web applications to easily manage these with visual effects. During the summer of 2016 I worked on a Tab Recovery System similar to the way Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox works. With that I was able to build a dialog to show the user what tabs they had left open. The last project I worked on there was a “Favorites” widget for the dashboard, where users could favorite there most used components of the application for a faster way to reach those components. At this internship I was able to work hands on with team members and was exposed to many technologies that I did not know existed. It was a great learning experience of the profession and a great way to reassure that I have found my passion.

                            I have some hobbies that just about every other computer nerd has: Playing video games, board games, and sports. I also enjoy grilling outside with friends enjoying time while we are all in the same central area, and watching my favorite school compete in just about any sport.
