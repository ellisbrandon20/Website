            		  Howdy! My name is Brandon Ellis and I am a Computer Science major at Texas A&M University, Class of 2017 from <a href="http://www.victoriatx.org/" target="_blank">Victoria,                Tx</a>. Victoria is located 2 hours South of Houston and about 2 hours North of Corpus Christi. With that being said you may recognize Victoria as "The Crossroads" of South            Texas. Most visitors are simply passing through town either stopping to get a bite to eat or getting rest to head back on the road the next day. In my spare time if I am not               working, studying, or coding, I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends.

                         I have always been interested on what all you can do with computers, tablets, and cellphones. Senior year in high school I had no idea what I wanted to do in my life so when              I applied to Texas A&M University I just went with my gut and chose Computer Science knowing I had an interest in computers. It wasn't until I took the class CSCE 111:                     Introduction to Computer Science Concepts and Programming that I knew I wanted to continue learning about computer science and make a career out of it. 
                    </p>
                    <p style = font-size:125%>
                        After having a taste of coding in that class I wanted more. I wanted to know what all is possible from just writing lines of code. I wanted to be able to create something one             day to help others, whether it's a webpage for a start-up business, or a simple app that explains how to use smart phones for non-tech-savvy people. That very next summer I               did research on what I could do with a degree in computer science and what I found was the possibilities were endless! I have never attended a computer science class not                 excited or ready to learn something new. Although some of the projects and tasks can be rigorous I enjoy taking it head on.

                        I have enjoyed my time so far here at Texas A&M University and if for some reason you are looking for a school to attend I encourage you to highly consider this school for               whatever degree you may be seeking.
